        <h1>You are the last hope of the universe.</h1>
        <p>Noooooo! I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! Ooh, name it after me! No,
            I'm Santa Claus! Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved.</p>
        <p>With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! <strong> Fatal.</strong> <em> Now that the, uh,
                garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions?</em> Do a flip!
        </p>
        <h2>You can see how I lived before I met you.</h2>
        <p>You're going to do his laundry? One hundred dollars. Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that!
            There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial?
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography.</li>
            <li>No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own!</li>
            <li>Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony?</h3>
        <p>She also liked to shut up! Daylight and everything. Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved
            anything. Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. Our love isn't any different from
            yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Oh sure! Blame the wizards!</li>
            <li>Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way?</li>
            <li>I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to
            use the phrase "upside your head." That's not soon enough! Oh, I always feared he might run off like this.
            Why, why, why didn't I break his legs?</p>
        <p>Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? And
            remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case,
            for the love of God, don't not do it!</p>
        <p>Tell her she looks thin. I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. I decline the title of Iron Cook and
            accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money.</p>
        <p>Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! It must be
            wonderful. Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there
            incompetence.</p>
        <p>Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up
            inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. Oh, I think we should just stay friends.</p>
        <p>Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the
            ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso!</p>
        <p>Oh yeah, good luck with that. Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater
            society above you! Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped.</p>
        <p>You are the last hope of the universe. The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You
            will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep. Daylight and everything. I haven't felt much of
            anything since my guinea pig died.</p>
        <p>Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. Why would I want to know
            that? I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up.
            Uhh… also, comes with double prize money.</p>
        <p>Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. Look, everyone wants to be like
            Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me
            the death penalty?</p>
        <p>Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life. Alright,
            let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. Hello Morbo, how's the
            family?</p>
